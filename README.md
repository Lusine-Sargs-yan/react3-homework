## Pages include the following tasks

## Memory Game
### You are presented with multiple images of celebrities. The images get shuffled every time they are clicked. User CAN NOT click on any image more than once or else the score resets to zero. 
### If the user clicks different images each time, the score increments.
### The user wins the game if the score equals the image count (it means the user always clicks a new image).


## Color Picker In React
	
### You need to have four sliders (or inputs) to control four parameters of the color: red, green, blue and alpha.
### Once you change the sliders (or inputs), you can see the background color changing based on the current parameters.


### Current weather tracker
### Map some cities in the / page, then when user clicks on custom city redirect to /selected-city and then get the weather data using the upper endpoint.
